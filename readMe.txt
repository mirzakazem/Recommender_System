in the main folder there is three files
1: Python file (.py)
2: jupyter notebook file (.ipynb)
3: HTML file (.html)

you need to have python installed to run both of them
for.ipynb file you need to have jupyter notebook installed to be able to use it
the HTML file is just a view of the jupyter notebook file. (in case jupyter notebook not available)

it is recommended to use .pynb file since it is more presentable, neat and it includes some graphs.
however, both file (.py & .ipynb) will give the same end result.


thank you
